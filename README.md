supportsatsupports
==================

A polyfill to add window.CSS.supports support to browsers that support `@supports` in CSS, but lacks the JavaScript API. It uses window.supportsCSS if available.

window.CSS.supports is the proposed object defined in the [CSS Conditional Rules Module Level 3](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-conditional/) specification. Opera added support for `window.supportsCSS()` in version 12.10 of the browser. Though `@support` is enabled in Firefox 17.0 behind a flag, the JavaScript API is not yet available.

Other browsers have not yet added support ([check current support tables](http://caniuse.com/#search=supports)).
